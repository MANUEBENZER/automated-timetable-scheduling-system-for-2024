<h1>B.Ed. Internship Curriculum</h1>
<p>
	Internship, like in medicine, is to acclimatize budding Teachers with the administrative side of their work. Teacher, as you will agree, has to be well versed in teaching content by means of appropriate methodology, at the same time, he cannot be ignorant to the conduct of administrative activities in the school. Therefore, any B.Ed. Course that is holistic in approach comes with appropriate emphasis on both sides-teaching and administration. This makes internship quite relevant to any B. Ed. Course. In this the pupil teacher is acquainted with the overall conduct of the school activities and record keeping. It may include, among other things, morning assembly, timetable , attendance register, stock register, conduct of periodical meetings, purchases & consumption.

	Internship, as such, orients and acquaints the pupil teacher with the overall working of the school to make him fit to conduct himself in all activities of the school.
