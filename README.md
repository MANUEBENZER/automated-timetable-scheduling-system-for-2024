# Automated-Timetable-Scheduling-System
This is a MongoDB based B.Ed. internships' management system with the key feature of computing an internship timetable for each student enrolled in the B.Ed. internship program.

B.Ed. programs in India typically have a teaching internship in their curriculum involving travelling to an assigned school and conducting a lecture. 
The B.Ed. students typically choose 2 subjects as their Major (example: Geography and Mathematics).

This system automates the process of computing an internship timetable for each B.Ed. student based on their Major subjects, proximity to school's location from their given address and the availability of a supervisor from the B.Ed. program to supervise/grade the B.Ed. student for their lectures.
The master user of the application is the internship program coordinator, who can add new schools with their classwise timetables. The coordinator can also enable/disable the school from being considered by the algorithm.

The coordinator can enter marks provided by the internship supervisor in the system, which also generates a graph depicting the semester-wise progress for each B.Ed. student.

The application also has a students' portal which allows them a 'View Only' access to their marks, progress charts and internship timetables, and an 'Edit' access for their personal/contact information.

Tech Stack: MongoDB, PHP, JavaScript/AJAX, R, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS.
